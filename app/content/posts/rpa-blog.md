## What is RPA?

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that uses software robots to automate repetitive, rule-based business processes. These bots mimic human actions like clicking, typing, and data extraction, executing tasks faster and with greater accuracy than manual work.

## Key Benefits

- **Increased Efficiency**: Processes complete in minutes instead of hours
- **Cost Reduction**: Lower labor costs and improved resource allocation
- **Error Minimization**: Consistent, accurate execution
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale operations without hiring additional staff
- **24/7 Operation**: Bots work continuously without breaks

## RPA Orchestration

Orchestration manages multiple bots and workflows across an organization:
- **Workflow Coordination**: Ensures bots execute in the correct sequence
- **Centralized Management**: Monitor and control all automation activities
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizes bot utilization
- **Error Handling**: Manages exceptions and retries

## RPA Architecture Components

- **Bot Development**: Creating automation scripts
- **Bot Deployment**: Releasing bots to production
- **Bot Execution**: Running automated processes
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Tracking performance metrics
- **Governance**: Policy enforcement and compliance

## Use Cases
